## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned that I cannot superpose a background image and a background color. In this case I could because the background image didn't take the whole screen.
- I reviewed the box-shadow syntax.
- I wasn't sure how to properly size to music icon in the Plan section. I used flexbox and padding properties but I am curious what other solutions might be more convenient.
- I used a new minimalist CSS reset:

* {
    vertical-align: baseline;
    font-weight: inherit;
    font-family: inherit;
    font-style: inherit;
    font-size: 100%;
    border: 0 none;
    outline: 0;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}

### Continued development

- I want to get more comfortable using flexbox.
- I want to use the right properties to size objects. I am still hesitant whether I should use flexbox, pixels, ems, rems...

### Useful resources

- I used Mdn and forum topics but did not write down the references this time.
